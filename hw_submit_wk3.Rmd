# Questions
#### 1. Load msleep data frame into R.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(lattice)
data("msleep")
head(msleep)
```

#### 2. How many mammals are in the msleep data frame? How many variables? Use two R functions to get this information.

```{r}
# 83 mammals in the data frame, 11 variables.
total_mammals <- matrix(msleep, nrow = 1, ncol = 1)
total_mammals
nrow(msleep)
ncol(msleep)

```
#### 3. Assume you want to explore the relationship between the variables body weight and total sleep time.\
• ***Frame a question about the relationship***

• What is the response variable and what type is it?\
Ans: The response variable is the **total amount of sleep** because the bodyweight of mammals would interfere with sleep_total.

• What is the explanatory variable and what type is it?\
**The body weight** is the explanatory variable. if the weight of mammals is heavier. The mammals do not have more sleep, the body weight is interfering with the total amount of sleep.

• What is the appropriate type of plot given the types of variables?\
set x axis = body weight\
set y axis= total amount of sleep\
then use geom_print to print.\


• Create the appropriate plot with body weight against the total amount of sleep.\
```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total))+
  geom_point()
```

• Interpret the plot - what does the shape tell you about the relationship?\

we can see the majority of mammals is light, so they spend a lot of time for sleep. Conversely, the mammals which have a heavy body, they have a few sleep.


#### 4. When you see a curved relationship in a plot, you can often get rid of these curves by taking a log transformation of either the explanatory and/or the response variable.\
• Create three plots: 1) Log(x), 2) Log(y) and 3) Log(x) and Log (y).
```{r}
# Log(x)
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = sleep_total))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth (se=FALSE)

```
```{r}
# Log(y)
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = bodywt, y = log(sleep_total)))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth (se=FALSE)

```
```{r}
# Log(x) and Log(y)
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = log(sleep_total)))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth (se=FALSE)
```
• Which plot appears best to you and why?\
ANS :Log(x), because the curve of log(x) is similar with straight line, we can directly know the tendency of there two connections.

#### 5. Color code the plot in part 4 by the diet of the animals (vore). Make the axis labels nice, change the theme to black and white, and add a title.\
```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = sleep_total, color = vore))+
  geom_point(shape = "triangle") +
  ggtitle("The relationship of mammal types, body weight and sleep amount ") +
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Body Weight (log)") +
  ylab("Sleep Total")
```

#### 6. In the plot from part 5, add the OLS line (without standard errors) to each vore category. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = sleep_total, color = vore))+
  geom_point(shape = "triangle") +
  ggtitle("The relationship of mammal types, body weight and sleep amount ") +
  theme_bw() +
   xlab("Body Weight (log)") +
  ylab("Sleep Total") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm )

```
Does the effect of body weight on sleep total appear larger for some diets?\
**ANS:** Herbivore and carnivore have a profound effect on body weight and sleep total, others are not too obvious.

#### 7. Also add the overall (across all vore types) OLS line (without standard errors) to the above plot. Make sure this line is black, dashed and has width of.5.\

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = sleep_total, color = vore))+
  geom_point(shape = "triangle") +
  ggtitle("The relationship of mammal types, body weight and sleep amount ") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Body Weight (log)") +
  ylab("Sleep Total") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, size = 0.5, colour = "black", se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm)

```

#### 8. Change the title of the legend to “Diet”.\

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = log(bodywt), y = sleep_total, color = vore))+
  geom_point(alpha = 10, shape = "triangle") +
  ggtitle("The relationship of mammal types, body weight and sleep amount ") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Vore Diet ", labels = c("carnivore",
"herbivore", "insectivore", "omnivore")) +
  xlab("Body Weight (log)") +
  ylab("Sleep Total")
```

#### 9. Reproduce the following plot. Note the values of the y axis, the outlier shapes, the lack of a legend, the color scheme and the background.(hint: I used the colorblind safe palette)\
```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data = msleep, aes(x = vore , y = sleep_total, fill = vore))+
  ggtitle("The Diet of Mammals & Sleep Total") +
  xlab("Vore Diet") +
  ylab("Sleep Total") +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 17) +
   theme_bw() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
 guides(fill = F)
```

#### 10. Reproduce the following plot:\

```{r}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~vore) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
 geom_smooth (se=FALSE, method = lm) +
xlab("Body Weight") +
ylab("Sleep Total")

```
